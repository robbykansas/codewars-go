- create function clamp inside the solve, if its 0 return 0 if its 255 return 255, else just return the parameter
- using fmt with `%02X` it will automatically return hex code from number
- or to be exact, `%X` will change the hex with uppercase `02` to get the hex into 2 string, like FFFFFF become FF
